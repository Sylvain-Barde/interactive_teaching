    "### The workshorse of economics: isoelastic and Cobb-Douglas functions\n",
    "\n",
    "For this last notebook, I want to provide a bit of a discussion of the reason you keep seeing a specific type of multivariate function in all the examples and exercises you've been doing over last few weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the multivariate differentiation examples in the previous weeks, especially those with an economics flavour, have used functions like $x^{\\frac{1}{3}}y^{\\frac{2}{3}}$. Why is this type of function so popular with economists? It all has to do with several desirable mathematical properties that these functions have.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Isoelastic functions\n",
    "\n",
    "While the name **isoelastic** might seem a bit grand and scary, as I said you've actually seen these functions already and worked with them. In particular, they've already been discussed in the notebook for week 5 on why economists love logs. We saw that if we picked a very specific equation for demand, we could end up in a 'best of both worlds' scenario:\n",
    "- A demand equation that is a non-linear function, which is much more realistic than the 'straight-line' functions often shown in textbook diagrams.\n",
    "- The equation can nevertheless be turned into a linear one (which is easier to work with) if you take logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed at the time, the **special** equation that gives us this property is the one we've since seen a lot of:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z = x^\\alpha y^\\beta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are two parameters. As explained in previous notebooks, if we take logs of both sides of this equation, we get an equation that is linear in the logarithms of $x$ and $y$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ln z = \\alpha \\ln x + \\beta \\ln y$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you might wonder, why the name ***isoelastic***? Well, it comes from the fact that the elasticities of $z$ with respect to $x$ and with respect to $y$ are **constants**, hence 'iso' (same) elastic. This can be shown pretty easily by taking the partial derivative of $z$ with respect to $x$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} = \\alpha x^{\\alpha-1} y^{\\beta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can replace this into the formula for the elasticity of $z$ with respect to $x$ and rearrange:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\epsilon_x^z \\; & = \\; \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}\\frac{x}{z}\\\\\n",
    "\\epsilon_x^z \\; & = \\; \\alpha x^{\\alpha-1} y^{\\beta}\\frac{x}{z}\\\\\n",
    "\\epsilon_x^z \\; & = \\; \\alpha \\frac{x^{\\alpha} y^{\\beta}}{z}\\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that $z = x^\\alpha y^{\\beta}$, we can replace this in the numerator. You can see that the $z$ terms then cancel out, leaving $\\alpha$ as the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\epsilon_x^z = \\alpha \\frac{z}{z} = \\alpha$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So this means that the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ parameters of the isoelastic function $z = x^\\alpha y^\\beta$ are actually the ***elasticities*** of the function. This is a very useful property, as it tells us that we can easily parameterise the function for a real-life scenario just by providing the elasticities. These can be estimated from data. In Statistics next term, and in econometrics next year you will be taught that if you have data for $x$,$y$,$z$ and you take the logarithm of the variables, you can use linear regression to estimate the log-linear form of the equation and get estimates for elasticities $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ln z = \\alpha \\ln x + \\beta \\ln y$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It's early day for this, so don;t worry too much about it at this stage, but this is one of the main reasons these kinds of functions are used in economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Cobb-Douglas function as a special case\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen the Cobb-Douglas function in last week's workbook, and you've already kind of worked on them in the exercises on multivariate derivatives. This type of function is an isoelastic function with the extra restriction that the elasticities add to one. if we look at the example above, this means assuming that $\\beta = 1-\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z = x^\\alpha y^{1-\\alpha}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of where this might be used in economic is a production function, where output is produced with capital $K$ and labour $L$. This is actually an example covered in the weekly exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q(K,L) = K^\\alpha L^{1-\\alpha}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that this type of function is isoelastic, it all the benefits discussed above, in terms of be able to interpret $\\alpha$ as the elasticity of output with respect to capital and $1-\\alpha$ as the elasticity of output with respect to labour. If you increase capital by 1%, output increases by $\\alpha$%, and if you increase labour by 1% output increases by $(1-\\alpha)$%. Note that the $\\beta = 1-\\alpha$ restriction therefore means that if you increase both capital and labour by 1%, output also increases by 1%. This is something that we tend to observe empirically, which is why this restriction is often used.\n",

    "Isoelastic functions have a very neat trick up their sleeves that makes them particularly useful for constrained optimisation. We'll use a general isoelastic function in the maths below, but this also works for the Cobb-Douglas case where you have $\\beta = 1-\\alpha$ (this is the case in the interactive widget above).\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the following constrained optimisation problem, where you have to maximise an isoelastic function, subject to a budget constraint. This could be a production function example, or a utility example like in last week's notebooks.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L} = x^\\alpha y^\\beta + \\lambda (M - p_x x - p_y y)$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Next, we divide the first by the second, side by side. Remember, this gives us the tangency condition I mentioned in the video, where the ratio of the slopes of the function we want to maximise equals the ratio of the slopes of the constraint. As we will see, it is at this point that most of the **apparent** complication actually simplifies away.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\alpha x^{\\alpha-1} y^\\beta}{\\beta x^\\alpha y^{\\beta-1} } \\; = \\;  \\frac{\\lambda p_x}{\\lambda p_y}$$\n",

    "\n",

The higher the value of $\\beta$ relative to $\\alpha$ and the lower $p_y$ relative to $p_x$, the more of good $y$ you want relative to good $x$. This is particularly useful when using a Cobb-Douglas production function with capital and labour, as this result directly gives us the optimal capital/labour ratio, i.e. the optimal mix of workers and machines.\n",

In the widget above, this is shows as a green dotted line once you fix the budget $M$ and the utility $U$. The second equation is the combinations of $x$ and $y$ that satisfies the budget constraint, and that is the blue line in the diagram, obtained by fixing $M$. As is standard for systems of linear equations, the solution to the problem is at the intersection of the two straight lines. In the widget above, if you select some prices and an elasticity $\\alpha$, you can increase/reduce the value of the budget and you will see that the optimal point simply moves up and down this fixed and linear first order condition.\n",

    "#### Wrapping up...\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this final notebook was to show why the isoelastic function $x^\\alpha y^\\beta$ is so common in economics. The answer, as I hope I've convinced you, is that despite looking a bit complicated at first glance due to the power terms, the function is actually very simple to work with: \n",
    "- It's various elasticities are actually given directly by the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ parameters, so not only do you not need to derive them (just the once to convince yourselves!), but they can easily be estimated from data. This will be a core focus of next year's econometrics modules.\n",
    "- Finding the constrained maximum of such a function essentially boils down to solving a system of linear equations, as the first order conditions of the Lagrangian, although initially scary-looking, simplify down to a constant $x/y$ ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this to say, when you are working with an isoelastic or Cobb-Douglas function in an exercise or in future modules, remember what to look for. If your derivation of the elasticity doesn't result in the $\\alpha$ / $\\beta$ parameters, or if your derivation of the Lagrangian FOCs does not produce a linear relationship between the two goods, you can be sure there is a mistake!\n"
