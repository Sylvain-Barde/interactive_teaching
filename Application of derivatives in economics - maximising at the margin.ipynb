    "### Maximisation at the margin: using derivatives in economics\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the maximum (or minimum) of a function is a common task in economics, as it is standard to assume that the behaviour of individual agents (firms, households, policy makers, etc.) is to find the maximum or minimum of a particular quantity that they care about. So for firms, this will typically be profits, while households are assumed to maximise their satisfaction. Policy makers might want to minimise inflation, or maximise social welfare, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This purpose of this particular notebook is therefore to illustrate how this is done in a very simple profit-maximisation example. This will also give us the opportunity to go over the specific notation used in economics, as well as some of the thinking behind the use of derivatives in economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I just said, we are going to look at a profit maximisation problem, and in order to make things simple, we are going to assume a monopoly, i.e. there is a single firm supplying a market. This means that the demand curve facing the firm is simply the demand curve for the entire market. So the goal of the monopolist is to maximise its profits $\\Pi$, which is simply the difference between the total revenue achieved by selling a quantity $Q$ and the total cost of producing that quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Pi \\; = \\; TR(Q) \\; - \\; TC(Q)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calculate the profit function, we therefore need a total revenue function and a total cost function. Let's start by looking at revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The revenue side\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already looked at one example of total revenue ($TR$) and average revenue ($AR$) in the notebook that covered applications of quadratic functions in economics. In that notebook, we saw that the U-shaped total revenue curve emerged as the product of two linear factors, quantity $Q$ and the (linear) demand curve, which also happens to be the average revenue ($AR$) curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below extends this a bit but the general picture stays the same. The $AR$ curve is actually the inverse demand curve on the market, and total revenue is simply obtained by multiplying it by quantity Q. The specific equation I've picked for the $AR$ curve is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$AR \\; = \\; -2Q^2 + 5Q +50$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The widget will allow you to play around with whatever numbers you want, but I'll stick with these for my explanations. If we multiply this by $Q$ we get the $TR$ curve, which is displayed in the right hand side diagram. We can assume here that quantity is measured in thousands of units.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$TR \\; = \\;AR\\;\\times\\;Q\\;=\\; -2Q^3 + 5Q^2 +50Q$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first way in which this diagram is different than the one in the total revenue notebook you saw before is that total revenue is now a cubic equation (we have a $Q^3$ term), and no longer a quadratic. We still retain the overall inverse U-shape of total revenue, but this allows more flexibility. In this example total revenue grows relatively slowly initially, but falls very fast after the maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second way in which the diagram is different is that we have an extra curve! This is labeled $mR$ for **marginal revenue**. The economic idea behind marginal revenue is that it is the extra revenue generated by selling one more unit of the good. From a mathematical point of view, as long as the original quantity is large (say thousands of units), so that this one-unit increase is comparatively small, then marginal revenue is essentially the first derivative of total revenue:\n",

    "\n",
    "Again, the numbers in the widgets can be moved around, but these work well for the purposes of the illustration. The $TC$ curve, shown on the right-hand side shows costs that grow slowly to start with but pick up sharply past a certain point. This can be explained by looking at the average cost of production $AC$, visible on the left. The equation for $AC$ can be obtained by dividing total cost by the quantity produced:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$AC \\; = \\frac{TC}{Q} \\; =\\; Q^2 - 4Q + 10$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the average costs $AC$ initially fall as the quantity produced increases, which is why the growth in total costs is initially so slow: while production costs will increase as you increase production, this is partially offset by the fact that the cost per unit is falling. This U-shaped feature of the $AC$ curve is very common: setting up a production plant has some big up-front costs: you may need to have a factory, purchase machinery, do some R&D to develop an attractive and competitive product, protect your intellectual property by paying for a patent, etc. All these expenses only need to happen once, so the more your produce, the more you can spread these costs over the volume of production. This is known as increasing returns to scale and explains why a product that is mass-produced is cheaper than a product manufactured in small volumes. \n",
    "\n",
    "This only last so long, however: past a certain point, increasing production will lead to increasing average costs, and the total cost curve will become very steep. As for the revenue diagrams above, we can also calculate the **marginal cost** of production $mC$ which is the increase in total costs resulting from the production of one more unit. As above, this is the first derivative of Total Cost with respect to quantity $Q$.\n",

Checking if the revenue from extra production covers the costs of doing so is something that firms can do empirically, without needed to take derivatives and solving first order conditions!\n",

    "Economists use derivatives all the time to find the maximum (or minimum) of functions we care about. It is important to understand, however, that we have developed a specific way of thinking of derivatives, which are typically called **marginal** values. Crucially, marginal values (costs and revenues in our examples) are more than just a replacement name for the same concept. As we have seen, thinking in terms of variables at the margin allows us to:\n",
    "- Simplify the process of finding the location of the maximum or minimum: we don't need to calculate the profit function and take its derivative (we work directly with the marginal quantities) and we don't need to explicitly take a second derivative to check we have a maximum (we can just compare the slopes of the marginal functions). This is why, for instance, economists constantly talk about optimisation but nearly never check the second order condition!\n",
    "- Get some intuition for how an agent might go about finding a maximum in practice (or something very close) without ever actually doing the maths. In our example, the firm just needs to check if the revenue from a bit more production covers the costs of that production, and stops when the two are equal. It's the same thing with you when you go shopping: you don't solve a big maximisation problem in your head, instead you compare the satisfaction you might get from various options.\n",
