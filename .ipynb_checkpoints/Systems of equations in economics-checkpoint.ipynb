    "The standard example is a supply and demand diagram, where the two unknown variables that we want to get are the equilibrium quantity $Q^*$ and the equilibrium price $P^*$. In order to be able to identify the values of these two variables, we need two equations. Conveniently, we can use the demand and supply curves. We are initially going to re-use the elasticities example from last week, focusing this time on solving for price/quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The demand/supply equations used in the diagram are technically known as *inverse* supply/demand, as they allow you to calculate the price that consumers are willing to pay or that suppliers are willing to accept for a given quantity. These are the inverse of 'normal' demand/supply functions tell you the quantity consumers are willing to buy or suppliers are willing to provide at a given price. However, you guys know by now that if you have a linear equation with two unknowns $x$ and $y$, you can always manipulate it to get two *functions* that give you $y$ as a function of $x$, or $x$ as a function of $y$. This is what we have here.\n",

    "\n",
    "As was the case last week, note that the minus in front of $a_d$ is there to explicitly state that the demand curve is downward-sloping. This means we are assuming $a_d>0$ and $a_s>0$. So we have two unknowns ($Q^*$ and $P^*$) and two equations (Supply and Demand) that have different slopes, so we should be in the clear: we know we can solve the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to assume that the *markets clear*, in other words we assume that at equilibrium all the goods produced by suppliers are bought by consumers, so $Q^* = Q_d=Q_s$. This immediately implies that the price paid by the consumer is the price received by the producer, so $P^*=P_d=P_s$. While this might seem trivial (it is) it is also an important statement: the system of equations above doesn't contain $P^*$ or $Q^*$, instead it has two different prices and two different quantities!!\n",
    "\n",
    "As a side note, this might seem very silly and unnecessarily complicated: why do we start by subscripting quantities and prices with $d$'s and $s$'s only to remove them just after? This is because sometimes markets *don't* clear, the quantities supplied and demanded don't match (shortage or surplus), and we then don't have an equilibrium. But more on that later...\n",

    "### Understanding the impact of a tax\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that an interesting prediction of the model is that the burden of the tax ends up shared between suppliers and consumers (toggle the 'show revenue button' to show/hide this). This is because despite the tax being charged to suppliers, they are able to pass on some of the tax to consumers. By the way, this would be the same if we had put the tax on consumers so that the price paid by consumers were increased $P_{dT} = P_{d} + T$. In this case, it is the the demand curve that would shift down, but by reducing their demand, the consumers would force suppliers to reduce their price and share the burden of the tax.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_d  = -a_d Q_d + b_d - T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the parameters in the diagram, the revenue generated by the tax is shared evenly between suppliers and consumers. This does not have to be the case in general, however. A neat feature of our little system of equations is that it can help us predict the impact of a tax depending on the elasticities of supply and demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case 1: Elastic demand, inelastic supply\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that the demand curve for a given good is relatively price elastic, in other words, if the price goes up by 10%, the quantity demanded falls by more then 10%. On the other hand, the supply curve is price inelastic, so if price goes up by 10%, the quantity supplied goes up less than 10%. Examples of this type of markets are high-end agricultural produce like organic food, free-range eggs/meat, artisan/hand-crafted cheese, etc. On the demand side, they are relatively price-elastic. They tend to already be relatively expensive to begin with compared with cheaper alternatives, and increases in price lead to more-than-proportional decreases in quantity demanded. On the supply side, all agricultural produce tends to be price inelastic. The quantity supplied is governed by physical constraints like the time it takes to grow produce, the weather, the size of your field/orchard/herd of cattle that make it very difficult to change the size of your production in response to price changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what happens if you put a tax on suppliers in in this kind of market? Well, as you can see below, the supplier is unable to pass the tax on to consumers and ends up impacted quite severely. So you really are taxing suppliers! The quantity does not change much, but the risk is that in the longer run farmers decide this is not a profitable activity so they simply give up and leave the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "This situation is actually what UK agricultural producers are facing with Brexit arriving soon. The UK actually has a lot of high quality, high-welfare agricultural production, and a lot of it gets exported to the EU single market. If no trade deal is agreed and tariffs get imposed on UK exports, UK farmers will face a situation like the one shown below."

    "\n",
    "This kind of case corresponds to a situation where the consumers will be prepared to buy a good regardless of its price (for example if it is a necessity that consumers cannot do without), but it is relatively easy for producers to increase or reduce their supply in response to price changes. A decent example would be electricity: it is hard to imagine living without it, so consumers will use it even if it is expensive, but as long as the overall demand does not exceed the generation capacity of suppliers, it is relatively easy for suppliers to spin up their generation if price increases. Furthermore, it is easy to imagine why we might want to tax suppliers: if they generate their electricity using fossil fuels (especially coal), then there is a very good environmental reason to tax suppliers, in order to try to discourage the use of fossil fuels. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, as you can see from the diagram, all that happens is that nearly all the tax is passed on to consumers, and the quantity produced does not change much... So a tax alone is counterproductive. Instead, policy-makers may want to add a subsidy for clean generation (renewable sources), so that the market can offer a cheap alternative.\n"

    "\n",
    "While the examples shown here are very simple, they provide two important illustrations:\n",
    "1. First, they illustrate how economists use systems of equations. It is often the case that we start off with *more* unknowns than we have variables. What we can do, however, is decide that some of these are *policy* variables (taxes, spending, interest rates, etc...) and we can solve the system so that the unknowns that are **truly** unknown (price, quantity, GDP, inflation, etc...) are functions of these policy variables. That way, when we choose the level of the policy variables, we can figure out their impact on the other variables.\n",
    "2. Second, they illustrate how even very simple models can nevertheless be very useful in shedding light on real-life situations. The model used here (supply/demand with a tax) is exactly the same in all the diagrams. As you can hopefully see, however, the story that you can tell changes dramatically depending on the values of the parameters. So play around with the parameters, and see if you can generate other interesting cases!\n"
