Like $\\pi$, $e$ is a mathematical constant that is irrational, i.e. it cannot be expressed as a ratio, and it's value is approximately 2.71828. \n",
    "\n",
    "The question we raised in the video was essentially as follows\n",
    "1. All logarithms have this nice property that $\\log(xy) = \\log(x) + \\log(y)$. You can pick any base you want and this property remains\n",
    "2. Some bases make very practical sense, like base 10 (our number system is base 10) or base 2 (for computer/software engineering)\n",

    "#### The problem of compounding interest in finance\n",
    "\n",
    "The number $e$ is named after genius Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707-1783), who worked a lot with its theoretical properties (Euler in particular proved it was an irrational number). He is the one who popularised the notation $e$ for this constant, which means the guy obviously thought he was a big deal! Euler did not discover $e$, however, that credit should go to Jacob Bernoulli, another giant swiss mathematician, who found out an expression for $e$ in 1683 (long before Euler). The route he used to find the value of $e$ was exactly the one we will use here, and had to do with finding the most profitable strategy for earning interest on a loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Banking and finance massively expanded in post-renaissance Europe, as larger, more expensive and more risky enterprises were set off, such as the rise of manufacturing, financing shipping expeditions to open new trade routes, etc. But the maths behind finance (especially probability theory) wasn't yet understood, and lending still relied on rules of thumb.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli essentially started with this setting: suppose you invest in a business or a security that doubles your initial investment after a time $T$. Most examples of this thinking will use 1 year, but actually (a) that's not very realistic and (b) we don't really care how long $T$ is, only that it exists. Even if the annual interest rate is very low, eventually you will double your money!\n",
    "\n",
    "We can plot this below, and it produces a boring diagram. You give away your money, and after $T$ time has passed, you get your money back with 100% interest, so your wealth doubles at that point."

    "Bernoulli then asked this crucial question: ***would it be a more profitable strategy to lend at the same rate for half the time***? In other words, you lend at the same rate, but ask for the loan to be repaid, with interest, at time $T/2$. You then re-lend all of what you received (capital plus interest) on the same terms, again for $T/2$. ***Are you better off?***\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is yes, and it is easy to see why (diagram below). For every pound you lend initially, you receive Â£1.5 at the halfway point $T/2$. Â£1 of this is the repayment of the initial capital, 50p is the interest. Of course, because you lent the money for half the time, you only get half the interest. But crucially, when you re-lend the money again immediately at the same interest rate, you are now lending Â£1.50, not Â£1. So for the second half of the diagram, the same interest rate applies to a larger amount of capital! When you get paid back the second time, you receive Â£2.25: Â£1.50 of that is the initial capital you lent, 75p of interest."

    "The diagram above shows what happens when you break $T$ down into four periods. At $T/4$, when the first round of lending is repaid, you only get 25p per pound of capital (you are only lending for 1/4 of the original period), but like before, getting paid some of the interest early so that you can increase the capital you are lending pays off in the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same logic as before, the amount you get for breaking up $T$ into 4 successive rounds of lending can be written as:\n",

    "You may have noticed, however, that while lending four times has increased the gain (so we are better off), it is less effective than the first time round. When we first split the lending period in two, we were 25p better off. Splitting into two again (so 4 loans) gained us 19.14p. So while this works, there is no 'magic money tree'. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli noticed this too, and so the ***real*** question that he answered was: what happens to the value of $A_n$ as you keep increasing $n$? Could you keep increasing your gains by lending for increasingly short periods of time, each earning smaller and smaller amounts?"

    "As you can see for the example above, where you slice the initial time period $T$ into 50 successive loans, the step curve you get really looks like it is converging to the exponential function $e^x$. And the value of your capital after a unit amount of time $T$ is starting to look suspiciously close to the number I gave above. This is no surprise. Bernoulli showed that the value of $A_n$ when $n$ tends to infinity is actually $e$. More formally:\n",

    "2. Growth happens continuously over time, and not in discrete jumps that happen at specific points in time. In our example this was the slicing of the loans into shorter and shorter periods of time, and in the limit, into a continuous process.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you an imagine, this has applications in a lot of places: even if a lot of biological or economic growth processes are actually discrete (like a cell dividing into two, or a firm being created), the individual units are so small, and there are so many of them that we can treat the overall process as continuous. The general form of the exponential in those cases is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A(t) = A_0 e^{rt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $A_0$ is the initial value of the quantity that is growing (or decaying if $r<0$), $r$ is the fixed rate of growth or decay (where 10% would be equal to 0.1) and $t$ is the amount of time elapsed. Our example of Mr Bernoulli's derivation simply had a combination of $r$ and $t$ that would be equal to one."
