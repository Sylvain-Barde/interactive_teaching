    "\n",
    "As this is the first 'deeper dive' notebook, let me begin by explaining them a bit for you. When you teach (or learn) maths, it often is the case that you don't cover all the angles of a given concept, either because it's not on the curriculum, or because it is a bit too advanced. Unfortunately, it is also often the case that these extra concepts are *really* useful for truly understanding a topic, because they answer the 'why' questions I refer to in the videos. So I've decided not to do the same as everyone else and and show you these deeper concepts, precisely because they give you insights into what is truly happening behind the scenes. Matrices are a perfect place to start. Don't worry, **none of the deeper dives are in the assessment**, and we will not expect you to master this stuff in any way. What we would like you to do is give it a try, so that you can take a peek behind the curtain and maybe, if I get my material right, marvel at the beauty of what is behind.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrices can transform space!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Like everything we have seen until now, matrices have a geometric interpretation. This should not be very surprising: we have seen that matrices are related to systems of equations, and we have also seen that systems of equations have a geometric counterpart in Cartesian space.\n",
    "\n",
    "So matrix algebra (the rather dry stuff we saw in the lecture videos) also has a geometric side. As I said, no real surprise. What is more surprising, as you hopefully will see, is that the geometric interpretation of matrix algebra is very different from what we have seen until now. Matrices open the door to something very deep and rather beautiful: matrices don't just encode locations in $(x,y)$ space (the way a linear function does), they can also encode *transformations of space itself*. This notebook will illustrate this step by step, allowing to visualise this deep property of matrices and also understand the 'dry' algebra a bit better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a simple example using the stuff we covered in the videos. Suppose you have a matrix $A$ as defined below and a point with coordinates $x=3$, $y=-1$. These coordinates are gathered into a column vector ${\\rm x}$.\n",

When you have a combination of transformations (say $AB$) applied to some data $D$, i.e you calculate $ABD$, the order in which the transformations are applied is right-to-left. You take $D$, then you apply the transformation $B$ then finally the transformation $A$. The order in which you carry out the transformations matters and in general applying $B$ first then $A$ will give a different result to $A$ first then $B$.\n"

Well, by using $a=2$ and scaling the space up, we are doubling every length in the diagram (such as the base and height of the red triangle).

In fact, this is precisely what the determinant measures. It is also why we use the vertical bar notation $|A|$ for the determinant, which some of you might remember means **absolute value** for scalars (good old regular numbers). This is because the determinant is a *generalisation* of the concept of absolute value. A scalar $a$ can be thought of as a $1\\times 1$ matrix, and if you multiply an unknown number $x$ by $a$, the absolute value $|a|$ tells you how much this one dimensional number (a length) has changed by. For a $2\\times 2$ matrix $A$, $|A|$ tells us how the 2D area is scaled. For a $3\\times 3$ matrix, $|A|$ tells us how the 3D volume is scaled.

    "#### Why you can't invert a matrix if its determinant is equal to 0\n",
    "\n",
    "So the determinant of a transformation tells us how much areas (or volumes if you have more dimensions) are scaled by when you apply the transformation. So what would a 0 determinant mean, from a geometrical point of view? Well, clearly, if we use the logic I talked about, wouldn't this mean that in our $2\\times 2$ example all areas would be shrunk to zero? In fact this is exactly what happens! See the example below: I have picked a matrix $A$ with $|A|=0$ and you can see that the original two-dimensional $(x,y)$ Cartesian space has collapsed to a one-dimensional space: a line. Any point you could have picked anywhere in the original space will get squeezed onto that line. The concept of an *area* or a *surface* does not exist for line, therefore the transformation generated by matrix $A$ squeezes any pre-existing area to zero.\n"

    "If you remember the discussion above, we saw that the geometrical reason why you can 'undo' the multiplication by a matrix $A$ when you do matrix inversion is that you can always use the location of the 'old' axes and grid lines to find the coordinates of the points before the space was transformed. In this case, our 2-dimensional space has collapsed into a 1-dimensional space, and you can no longer do this. In the transformed picture, both the original $x$ and $y$ as well as all the old gridlines get squeezed on top of each other onto the single 1-dimensional line that is our new space. Given that all these lines are now on top of each other, we can't count the grildlines parallel to the old $x$ or $y$ axis to get the coordinates: they don't exist anymore!\n",

    "\n",
    "For those of you that have made it this far, I hope the payoff is worth the effort: You should now have a much better understanding of what matrices actually do, and why some of their funny properties (like $AB \\ne BA$) are what they are. As I keep explaining, algebra is useful when you need to calculate things, but often, it is the geometric connection that helps you truly visualise and understand what is really going on.\n"
