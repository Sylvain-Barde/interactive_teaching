    "### Elasticities: An application of linear functions in economics\n",
    "\n",
    "Elasticities are a really important concept in economics, and we will be referring to them a lot not only in this module, but also throughout your degree. Their definition is rather simple, yet they are incredibly useful. Let's start with definitions. You may have seen this before, ad you'll definitely see it again, but I want to make sure everybody is clear on we are talking about before we start playing around with the concept and providing some illustrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have two variables $A$ and $B$, the elasticity of $B$ with respect to $A$ is the percentage change in $B$ (written $\\%\\Delta B$) divided by the percentage change in $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_A^B = \\frac{\\%\\Delta B}{\\%\\Delta A}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that the elasticity is equal to 0.5. The way we interpret this is to say that if $A$ increases by 1%, B will increase by 0.5%. If $A$ increases by 10%, B will increase by 5%. A common elasticity used in economics is the price elasticity of demand (or more precisely the elasticity of demand with respect to price).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_P^D  = \\frac{\\%\\Delta Q_d}{\\%\\Delta P}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The price elasticity of demand is usually negative (higher prices lead to lower demand) and it tells us how responsive demand is to price. If it is less than one in absolute value, so $|E_P^D| < 1$, a 1% increase in price leads to a less than 1% fall in quantity demanded, and we say that demand in *inelastic*. If instead $|E_P^D| >,  1$ a 1% increase in price leads to a more than 1% fall in quantity demanded, and we say that demand in *elastic*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What do linear functions have to do with this?\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be asking yourselves this, and it's a valid point. To explain the connection, we have to get a more detailed definition of an elasticity. The first step it to look at the idea of percentage change: How do we calculate $\\%\\Delta Q_d$? Well, the definition of a percentage is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\%\\Delta Q_d = 100\\times\\frac{\\Delta Q_d}{Q_d}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\Delta Q_d$ is the change in quantity (either an increase or decrease). So if your initial quantity is 500 and it increases to 510, then the change $\\Delta Q_d$ is 10. This corresponds to a percentage change of 2%:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\%\\Delta Q_d = 100\\times\\frac{10}{500} = 2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The same formula applies to the percentage change in price $\\%\\Delta P. If we replace the percentage change formulas in the definition of an elasticity, by the definitions we just provided we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_P^D  = \\frac{100\\times\\frac{\\Delta Q_d}{Q_d}}{100\\times\\frac{\\Delta P}{P}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This doesn't look very friendly, but not to worry: it does simplify nicely. First of all, the 100 terms in the numerator and denominator cancel out. Secondly, we can make use of the fact that division is simply multiplication be the inverse (remember, dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying by one third!):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_P^D  = \\frac{\\frac{\\Delta Q_d}{Q_d}}{\\frac{\\Delta P}{P}}  \\quad = \\quad \\frac{\\Delta Q_d}{Q_d}\\frac{P}{\\Delta P}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we rearrange the denominators, we get the standard definitions of the price elasticity of demand:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_P^D  = \\frac{\\Delta Q_d}{\\Delta P}\\frac{P}{Q_d}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first fraction in this definition is simply the slope of the demand curve $\\frac{\\Delta Q_d}{\\Delta P}$. For a linear function, this is always fixed. The second fraction is simply the price/quantity ratio for a given point on the demand curve. an important implication is that **very point on the demand curve will have a different elasticity**. This can easily be illustrated: change the quantity in the diagram below, and you will see the elasticity change.\n"

    "\n",
    "This is a bit of tangent, but it does offer an important clarification of how economists use the terms 'elastic' or 'inelastic' for supply and demand curves on market diagrams. Before jumping in, you need to know that you can define price elasticities of supply $E_P^S$ just like the price elasticity of demand seen above. The only difference is that we look at how the quantity supplied $Q^s$ changes as price changes, rather than quantity demanded $Q^d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, so you will sometimes be shown a diagram where either the supply curve, or the demand curve, or both, have a very steep slope (see below), and the curves will be referred to as *inelastic*. This is broadly correct, however, it is a bit of a shortcut, and it gives the impression that the fixed slope corresponds to a fixed elasticity. If you check the example below, which shows an 'inelastic' market, you will see that the elasticities *still change* on the curves when you change the quantities. So while it is true that the elasticities you will see are all below 1 in magnitude, (hence the term 'inelastic'), it would be wrong to conclude that they are constant."

    "### Back to the main event: why are elasticities useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know that the elasticity of a demand or supply curve at a given point is the product of the slope and the price/quantity ration at that point, we may well ask: why is that useful? Well, in practice economists tend to use elasticities in the opposite direction to what they were taught.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we learn/teach elasticities, we give you the price, quantity and the slope of the demand/supply curves, and use that information to calculate elasticities. This is an important step, because it helps students understand the concept of an elasticity. In practice however, it is important to understand that *no economist has ever seen a supply or a demand curve*!! Demand and supply are very helpful theoretical constructs that help us model what is happening in the economy, but nobody has ever seen one on the high street or in a supermarket... \n",
    "\n",
    "So when an economist wants to give some policy advice about a specific market, they initially have **no idea** what the demand/supply curves look like. They can observe the market price and the quantity being exchanged, but that's it: they can't see the curves... \n",
    "\n",
    "What they can do is collect data on prices and quantities over time on that market, and use statistical techniques to get estimates of the elasticities (how sensitive the quantities are to price changes). This calculating elasticities from data is something you will see next year in econometrics. Then, once they know the elasticity, the price and the quantity, they can invert the elasticity formula to calculate the slope of the supply/demand curves around the market equilibrium. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\Delta Q_d}{\\Delta P} = E_P^D \\frac{Q_d}{P}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So elasticities, which we can measure from data, **allow us to build a linear approximation of the supply/demand curves look around the market equilibrium**!! This is illustrated below: pick a price and a quantity for your market, and pick some elasticities. The widget will plot what the supply and demand curves look like around your chosen equilibrium. Try changing the quantity or price for a given level of the demand/supply elasticities, and get an idea of how the local demand/supply curves respond..."

    "\n",
    "In conclusion, elasticities are used all the time by professional economists, but perhaps not in the way you think. They are very useful *as is* to give an idea of how one variable might react to another. But they're also very very useful in allowing us to link our models to the data, because they allow us to get the slopes of our functions from data we estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just because we give you practice exercises in which we ask you to calculate elasticities given a known demand or supply function doesn't mean that this is how the concept is used in practice. In the real world, *things work the other way round*: economists don't know what the demand curve looks like to begin with, so instead, they estimate the elasticity from data and they use that to get the slope... \n",
    "\n",
    "So, you may well ask: why do we give you the exercises where you calculate the elasticity from the slope of the demand curve??\n",
    "1. The statistical techniques used to estimate elasticities from data are typically taught later in your economics course (2nd year for you guys).\n",
    "2. The exercises are still very useful in getting you to understand how the two concepts are connected: you need to learn to walk before you can run."
