    "But from an *economic* point of view we have a massive elephant in our room: a linear function must intersect the axes. We clearly have a point where $P=0$, and the curve tells us that at that point, the quantity demanded is a reasonable 12.5 units. Similarly we have a point where the quantity demanded is 0 units, which happens when the price is 25. If you stop and think for a second, this doesn't match with our everyday experience of the real-life economy:\n",
    "- When a good becomes extremely scarce (the quantity available on the market tends to 0), the price people are willing to pay will become disproportionally higher the lower the quantity. This can reach a point where extremely scarce goods (maybe 1-2 units available) have to be sold at auction so that the good goes to the people who value it the most. A good examples here are paintings by Vincent van Gogh... \n",
    "- On the other hand, when a good is so cheap as to become essentially free, then demand for it can expand disproportionally. A 'reverse' example here are plastic carrier bags in supermarkets, which where initially free of charge. Because they were perceived as having no value, they were overused and thrown away carelessly, with all the environmental damage we know about. A simple increase in price from 0p (free) to 5p per bag [reduced the quantity demanded by consumers by 90%](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/plastic-bag-charge-supermarkets-figures-reduction-a9029996.html)\n",

    "The solution to this problem is simple: use a non-linear demand function, which results in a true **curve**. This way, you can capture these two effects: quantity demanded will expand very fast as price goes to zero, and price will rise very quickly when the quantity people can buy falls to zero. It is often the case that reality requires us to use ***non-linear*** functions!\n",

    "\n",
    "Life doesn't often allow us to have our cake and eat it, but this is one of the rare occasions where we can. Consider the following non-linear demand function for good 1, where the quantity demanded for good 1, $Q_1$, is a function of the price of good 1, $P_1$, and the price of a second good, $P_2$. $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are two positive parameters, and they make the quantity demanded of good 1 a negative function of $P_1$ (as expected) and a positive function of the price of the other good $P_2$ (in other words, the goods are substitutes, like tea and coffee).\n",

    "This function is plotted on the left hand side plot in the diagram below. Note that this plots quantity as a function of price, unlike the plot above, which shows the inverse demand curve where price is a function of quantity. If you look at the plot, you will see that this demand curve is more realistic. For very low values of the price, the quantity demanded shoots up (think free plastic carrier bags) and at very high prices the quantity demanded becomes low, but doesn't completely vanish (think rare items in auctions).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this, the specific equation picked for the demand function has a very interesting property: it becomes **linear** if you take its logarithm! Let's see this step by step. First, we take the natural log of both sides of the equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ln Q_1 = \\ln \\left(P_1^{-\\alpha}P_2^{\\beta}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "On the left hand side, not much will happen. On the right hand side, because $\\ln(xy) = \\ln(x) +\\ln(y)$ we can split the product of the terms containing $P_1$ and $P_1$. \n",

You have two unknown variables ($P_1$ and $P_2$), and two equations to solve them. All you need to do is solve the system! Solving the system above is absolutely possible, it can be done by substitution: you isolate one price (say $P_1$) in the first variable, substitute in the second. I am sure that you can see, however, that this requires working with powers in a way that adds quite a bit more complication.\n",

    "All we need to do now is use the methods we saw in the system of equations videos, either substitution or direct elimination. If you have a larger demand system, with more goods and more prices, you can see that you could also write this as a matrix, feed it to a computer and get the solutions for the log prices $p_i$. Once you have your log prices $p_1$, $p_2$, etc. the only extra step you need to do is take the exponential to recover the prices $P_1 = e^{p_1}$, $P_2 = e^{p_1}$.\n",

    "This little example was designed to serve two purposes. The first is to give you an illustration of why logarithms are so useful in economics: they allow us to account for some of the features of real-life economies at very little 'mathematical. cost. As long as we pick the right type of function, we can have non-linear features but still work in linear terms if we want too. Next year, when you take econometrics, you will see that while the basic tools we use typically allow us to estimate **linear** functions, using logs allows us to get around this to fit non-linear data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second purpose is to give you an understanding of why economists often use functions that look like that demand curve: we use these curves as they are a good compromise between being realistic and having a tool that is relatively easy to work with. That doesn't mean that we 100% believe that the world follows such equations **exactly**, just that we think that they are close enough while still being usable. We will see examples of these later in the term, when we start looking at multivariate calculus."
